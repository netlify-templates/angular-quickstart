Current State EOD Saturday
  - I need to verify JSON-LDs on twon pages
  - I need to setup town config file for meta data for each page
  - I need to need to correct json and meta data across the website including URLs and images and areas served order
  - I need to add the policy and terms of service and empty state pages
  - I need to add attr to all images and buttons across the website
  - I need to remove the links to all the smaller towns from the homepage


Finish all the pages
  - add backlinks from the town pages to the service pages
  - make the corrections and suggestions made by dad
  - correct the styling for mobile devices
  - add a section giving a brief overview of each city
  - Finish the contact us page
  - add images
  


Add the pages in the footer
I need to update the SEO reload upon page switches using ng destroy
Rework all the town pages to use the shared component
Add hours of operation
Move footer into the index.html file outside of the body portion
I want to make the toolbar sticky 

Ask chatgpt to do the following when you push everything to netlify: "If you tell me what your Netlify publish directory currently is (what folder contains the built index.html after ng build), I’ll give you the exact netlify.toml (build command + publish dir) that matches your output structure."

I think I want to have two rows to the toolbar with the social media icons on the top


// @Nathaniel what does this mean?:"Netlify config (works for both CSR + prerender)
If you have any routes that are NOT prerendered, you still want the SPA fallback redirect:
src/_redirects
/* /index.html 200
And make sure it’s copied by Angular build (Netlify docs note adding it to assets)."
